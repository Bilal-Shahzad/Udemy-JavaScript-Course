// binary operators 
// Requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator.
// operands- the quantity on which an operation is to be done.

// 2 + 3; or x * z
// 4 + 5; or x * y

// unary operators
// Requires a single operand, either before or after the operato

// ++, +, *, - , --, &

// Arithmetic Operators: Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Addition and Subtraction
// Takes numerical values as their operands and returns a single number

var count = 10 + 5 - 4; // 11

var mult = 3 * 5; // 15

//Modulus Operators
// This will give us the remainder of two values.

21 % 4; // 1


//Assignment Operators
// Assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.
// operand- the quantity on which an operation is to be done.
// basically the "="

var count = 5;

//Comparison Operators
// Compare both sides of equation and returns a  value based on if the comparison is true. They can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

// Checks for equality in value. (Equality operator)
5 == '5'; // true

5 === '5' // false
// === Checks for equality in value and type. (Strict equality operator)


// sting operator
// When the ‘+’ is used on strings the ‘+’ operator is called the concatenation operator.
// the + is the string operator 

// 'Hello' + ' ' + 'world'; // 'Hello world'
